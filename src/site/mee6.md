## Conclusion

So which one do you choose?

* If you're already using MEE6 Premium, then use <u>MEE6</u>.
* If you're not using MEE6 Premium, it's hard to recommend for it's 2min recording limit, so use <u>pawa</u>.

Regardless of which route you end up going, if you care about your recording, **ALWAYS** have a backup, whether that's another recording bot or some form of local recording with a tool like Audacity. Better be safe than sorry.
