    implementation quite right, so decided to remove it.

### Fixed
- One 2022-03-01 Discord made a change to the Voice handshake protocol which broke the audio recording feature.
  More details on the [JDA release](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA/releases/tag/v5.0.0-beta.5)

## [2.11.0] - 2022-12-23

### Added
- `/volume` command that works exactly like `!volume`
- `/save` command that works exactly like `!save`, except that the slash command must reply so it
  sends a check mark ‚úîÔ∏è 
- `/stop` command that works exactly like `!stop`
- `/record` command that works exactly like `!record`
- `/lang` command that works exactly like `!lang`
- `/ignore` command that works exactly like `!ignore`
  - Except that you can only ignore one user at time, must run command multiple times
- `/autosave` command that works exactly like `!autosave`
- `/autostop` command that works exactly like `!autostop`
  - Except that the setting can only be changed for one channel at a time

- Slash commands don't seem to respect permissions, this may be an issue in the current version of
  JDA, will be updating to the latest version in the coming weeks
- `autostop` can now accept 0 as the threshold which is equivalent to `off`

### Fixed
- #44 Recording would get lost if channel didn't have MESSAGE_ATTACH_FILES permissions,
  now a recording won't start if this permission is missing.
- #54 No more double AutoStop message
